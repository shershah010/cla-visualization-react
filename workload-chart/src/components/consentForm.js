        <h2>Key Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You are being invited to participate in a research study.
            Participation in research is completely voluntary.
          </li>
          <li>
            The purpose of the study is to investigate how the provision of
            novel course workload analytics improves academic outcomes and
            well-being.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you agree to participate, your academic grades, dropped courses,
            course enrollments, and withdrawal from their program and university
            where applicable is collected for research purposes at the end of
            the semester.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control
            condition based on your academic advisor. If you are assigned to the
            intervention platform, you will receive access to a novel platform
            displaying advanced course workload analytics of courses at your
            institution.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you agree to participate, your interactions with and accesses of
            the platform are logged and linked to your academic information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Risks and/or discomforts may include the risk of breach of
            confidentiality.

          <li>
            There are no direct benefits to participants, but participants in
            the intervention condition might experience improved academic
            outcomes and reduced course-related stress.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this research study is to understand the influence of
          the availability of advanced course workload analytics (related to
          time load, mental effort, and psychological stress) on academic
          outcomes and well-being throughout an academic semester.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>
        <p>
          If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to do the
          following: Students are randomly assigned to the intervention and
          control condition based on their assigned academic advisor.
          Intervention students who consented receive an additional link on
          their advising platform that redirects them to the course load
          analytics (CLA) dashboard. The CLA dashboard platform assigns an anonymous 
          ID for tracking based on their
          institutional SSO login. Logging of platform use includes time of page
          access, number of page accesses, time spent, and timestamped
          clickstream data/clicks. The platform includes weekly and overall CLA
          analytics for each course the student is currently enrolled in, and
          the student can also look up courses and their CLA. The CLA dashboard
          platform remains available throughout the semester. At the end of the
          semester, a summary report of de-identified studentsâ€™ interactions with the CLA
          platform, their academic grades, dropped courses, course enrollments,
          and withdrawal from their program and university (where applicable) is
          collected and shared with investigators.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Study Time</h2>
        <p>
          All use of the CLA dashboard is completely optional, hence no study time estimate
          is available.
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>
          We hope that the information gained from the study will help us
          improve academic advising. There are no direct benefits to you for
          participating in this study, but participants in the intervention
          condition might experience improved academic outcomes and reduced
          course-related stress.

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Risks/Discomforts</h2>
        <p>
          Course load analytics may influence your course selection decisions
          while being in itself an imperfect measure (i.e., prediction) of
          actual workload. Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that our
          intervention will discourage you from taking courses that would have
          otherwise benefitted you (more than other courses) or encourage you to
          take courses that have surprising levels of workload or other
          suboptimal outcomes for you, such that you would drop that course.
